# CSUSM_PARKING_BUDDY
CS490 Capstone Project:

Project Description
CSUSM has multiple parking lots, however, during the rush hours, it is still very difficult for
students to find a parking spot. Sometimes students may need to move across different parking
lots in order to find one, which could cause significant delays. To help resolve this, this project
aims to build a crowd-sourced mobile app that allows students to contribute their nearby
parking spots info. At the same time, students using this app could quickly and
easily find an available parking spot. Around 14,000 students on
campus will use this app, potentially impacting the whole CSUSM community.

• The project team shall follow software engineering best practices
• The project team shall use Git for app development management
• The project team shall practice agile methodology
